\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this paper, we adopt a variant of convolutional neural networks with triplet loss to perform end-to-end learning that can automatically generate the most suitable mid-level features for image sentiment analysis tasks. We also designed a specific triplet selection schemes for mid-level representations commonly used in image sentiment analysis. We show the effectiveness of our approaches by detecting both mid-level representations and predicting sentiment of various image datasets and show significant improvement against baseline approaches.
